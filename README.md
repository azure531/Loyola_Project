Loyola Project
Overview
A system for early text classification using preprocessing, partial information classification, and decision-making algorithms.

Steps
Preprocessing
Clean and standardize text data with tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization.

Partial Information Classifier
Classifies text based on incomplete information, allowing early predictions.

Context Analysis
Enhances classification by considering the context of the text.

Decision Making
Combines results from different models to improve accuracy.

Early Text Classification
Focuses on identifying document categories with minimal input data for faster predictions.
